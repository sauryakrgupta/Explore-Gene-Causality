# Explore-Gene-Causality
This project explores gene causality by analyzing embeddings of phenotypes and genes to determine if their relationships signal causality, using dimensionality reduction, vector analysis, and clustering techniques.

Phenotypes are traits or conditions that we can observe in an individual, which are influenced by genes. A causal gene is one that directly influences the development of a trait or disease.
Variations in this gene can result in observable changes in the phenotype, making it a key target for genetic studies. Figuring out which genes are causal (for a particular phenotype) from many possible candidates is essential in fields like medicine, genetics, and biology. This knowledge helps in creating specific treatments and diagnostics by understanding the genetic foundations of different traits and conditions.

Now, what makes a gene causal?
Numerous researchers have pursued this question and published their findings in literature. Literature, which is accessible to us, has also been used to train Large Language Models - like OpenAI’s and Meta’s GPT and Llama respectively. It's plausible that these models, when asked about specific phenotypes or genes, generate embeddings that reflect the literature's consensus on their genetic associations.
